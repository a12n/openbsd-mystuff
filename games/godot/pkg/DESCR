Godot is a fully featured, open source, MIT licensed, game engine.
It focuses on having great tools, and a visual oriented workflow
that can export to PC, Mobile and Web platforms with no hassle. The
editor, language and APIs are feature rich, yet simple to learn,
allowing you to become productive in a matter of hours.

Godot has been developed by Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur for
several years, and was born as an in-house engine, used to publish
several work-for-hire titles. Development is sponsored by OKAM
Studio.
